    private String color;
    //we can proceed now

    // okay :) u r great :) as i told you these properties are private so u cannot acess them outside from the class
    // so we have to write ooooooor generate a method or function so we can reach them

    //right click here in the place between the {} and generate getter and setter do not forget to select all of the properties

        //as u can see its public so we can acees them where we want pls do tha same with the house and the door



    // on more thing if u can make git commits and pushes much more easier here i show u how
// cool :) if u check now u got evrything on the github server online
    //if u made the new classes u can commit and push tehem and if u tell that to me i can check it evrytime
    //cool,i will submit the home work on there :).
    // :) okay can we solve that to speak during a session like this? it would be much more easier to show tricks and tips
    //yes
