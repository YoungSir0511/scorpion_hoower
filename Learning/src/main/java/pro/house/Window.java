    // okay :) u r great :) as i told you these properties are private so u cannot acess them outside from the class

    //right click here in the place between the {} and generate getter and setter do not forget to select all of the properties

        //as u can see its public so we can acees them where we want pls do tha same with the house and the door



    // on more thing if u can make git commits and pushes much more easier here i show u how
